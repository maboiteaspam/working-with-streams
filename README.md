# working with streams

my repo-playground to test and try about streams.

After few months working with streams,
somehow it remains surprising from time to time,
so i seriously needed to put that down and try to clarify few things.

Your warmly welcome to fix me when i did some weird stuff !!

## through2

All examples are based on `rvagg/through2` module, as it helps to create streams and transforms in a glance.

## examples

I have put down 10 examples so far.

From the most basic one, which just illustrate the stream methods,
to more complex one, with flush functions pending for tasks endings.

## Usage

Clone the repo, then run the script, modify them, study ect. whatever.

```sh
git clone git@github.com:maboiteaspam/working-with-streams.git
cd working-with-streams
node 10* --verbose
```
